Project Overview

As part of our server-side programming course, we analyzed the provided frontend files and created a backend server. This backend server retrieves data from the SQL database and grants access of the data to the frontend. In this project, Node.js and Express.js was used to execute CRUD operations, while SQL was utilized for data storage. The main goal of this project was to develop a robust backend server using REST APIs.
